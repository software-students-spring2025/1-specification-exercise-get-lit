# Specification Phase Exercise

### Problem Statement: 
Many individuals experience feelings of sadness or loneliness and seek comfort through interactions with friendly, fluffy cats. However, they may not have the ability or desire to take on the responsibility of pet ownership.

### Target Demographic: 
Individuals who experience emotional distress or loneliness and find solace in petting cats but prefer not to own one. This includes city dwellers who appreciate the companionship of bodega cats and seek convenient ways to locate and interact with them.

## Stakeholders
### Omar Khan:
"I like interacting with cats in local NYC bodegas, but am
facing issues reliably identifying which bodegas actually contain bodega
cats within their hallowed walls.

As a stakeholder in the Bodega Cat Identifier project, I'm hoping the
solution will allow me to efficiently be able to seek out the location
of feline friend-containing stores in order for me to 
quickly path my way to meeting more cute cats.

An expected outcome of this project for me will include my being able to
use the tool to identify which delis have cats in them, with a stretch
goal being the identification of which cats populate each respective bodega
ahead of time."

### Goals:
1. Enable users to locate nearby bodegas with resident cats efficiently.
2. Support and promote local businesses by increasing foot traffic to bodegas.
3. Provide advance knowledge of the number of cats present in each store.
4. Offer detailed information about each cat’s personality and petability to enhance user experience.

### Problems/Frustrations:
1. Lack of information regarding which bodegas have resident cats.
2. Uncertainty about the friendliness and petability of the cats.
3. Inability to determine whether the cats are hypoallergenic before visiting.
4. Limited knowledge of the breed and physical appearance of the cats.
