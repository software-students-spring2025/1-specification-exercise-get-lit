StakeHolder Interview:
Omar Khan: "I like interacting with cats in local NYC bodegas, but am
facing issues reliably identifying which delis actually contain deli
cats within their hallowed walls.

As a stakeholder in the Bodega Cat Identifier project, I'm hoping the
solution will allow me to efficiently be able to seek out the location
of feline friend-containing convenience stores in order for me to 
quickly path my way to meeting more cute cats.

An expected outcome of this project for me will include my being able to
use the tool to identify which delis have cats in them, with a stretch
goal being the identification of which cats populate each respective deli
ahead of time."
